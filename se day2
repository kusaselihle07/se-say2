Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is an essential tool in software development that helps track changes in code over time. It allows developers to manage different versions of their project, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions if needed. Git is one of the most widely used version control systems, and GitHub is a cloud-based platform built around Git, offering additional features that facilitate collaboration and project management. GitHub is popular because it provides a centralized space for teams to work together, track issues, review code, and integrate with other tools for automation and continuous deployment. It is widely used in both open-source and private projects due to its ability to maintain project integrity and history.Version control is an essential tool in software development that helps track changes in code over time.
